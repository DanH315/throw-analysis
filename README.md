# Throw-Analysis
Code mainly lifted from [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/pose-detection/demos).

Site available here https://monash-dodgeball.github.io/throw-analysis/index.html?model=movenet.
Make sure that the model is in the query string (will raise error otherwise).

Doesn't currently work in Firefox because the default video codec isn't supported for some reason.
